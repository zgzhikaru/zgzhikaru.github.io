## Dynamics Uncertainty / Model Mispecification Problem

## Approaches

### Robust MDP

A line of classical works has been dealing with the dynamics uncertainty problem under a robust optimization/robust control. 

Two representative works are
* [Robust Dynamic Programming](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.1040.0129)
* [Robust Control of Markov Decision Processes with Uncertain Transition Matrices](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0216)

### Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning

Formulating the environment adversary as a competing agent. 

The representative work is
* [Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02702)

### Meta-Learning

### Model-based RL
